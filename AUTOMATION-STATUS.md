# Recipe Automation System Status

## Current State

The application currently provides:
- ✅ **Beautiful UI Dashboard** - Fully functional interface for managing websites
- ✅ **Website Management** - Add, search, filter, and select websites for automation
- ✅ **Basic API Endpoints** - Mock endpoints that return informative messages
- ⚠️ **Demo Mode** - Automation buttons work but show demo messages

## What's Missing for Full Automation

### 1. PinClicks Browser Automation
- Need to implement Playwright/Puppeteer scripts to:
  - Log into PinClicks with credentials
  - Navigate to recipe search
  - Enter keywords and collect results
  - Parse recipe data

### 2. Notion Integration
- Need to implement Notion API calls to:
  - Create/update recipe entries in database
  - Sync website configurations
  - Track performance metrics

### 3. Email Reporting
- Need to implement email service to:
  - Send daily automation reports
  - Alert on errors or issues

### 4. Database Setup
- Need to set up Prisma with SQLite/PostgreSQL for:
  - Storing automation history
  - Tracking recipe collections
  - Managing website configurations

## Environment Variables Needed

Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
PINCLICKS_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
PINCLICKS_PASSWORD=your-password
NOTION_API_KEY=your-notion-api-key
NOTION_RECIPES_DB_ID=your-recipes-database-id
NOTION_WEBSITES_DB_ID=your-websites-database-id
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
```

## Next Steps

To make the automation fully functional:

1. **Install dependencies locally**: Run `npm install` to get Playwright, Notion client, etc.
2. **Implement browser automation**: Create services for web scraping
3. **Add Notion sync**: Implement API calls to save recipes
4. **Set up database**: Configure Prisma and run migrations
5. **Add email service**: Implement notification system

## Why It's Demo Mode

Due to the complexity of setting up:
- Browser automation (requires headless browser configuration)
- API integrations (requires API keys and proper authentication)
- Database setup (requires migrations and schema setup)

The current deployment shows the UI and workflow but returns demo messages when automation is triggered. This allows you to see how the system would work without the backend complexity.
