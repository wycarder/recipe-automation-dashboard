# Enhanced Website Management - Feature Implementation

## Branch: `feature/enhanced-website-management`

## Overview
This feature branch addresses three critical issues with website management in the Recipe Keyword Automation dashboard:
1. ✅ Removed the 45 website limit
2. ✅ Added edit/delete functionality for website tiles
3. ✅ Implemented bulk keyword import in the context editor

---

## Changes Made

### 1. No Website Limit (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: The application appeared to cap at 45 websites maximum.

**Solution**: 
- Investigated and confirmed there was NO hardcoded limit in the code
- The 45 website count came from the `data/all-websites.json` file which contains exactly 45 websites
- The architecture already supports unlimited websites through dynamic state management
- Users can now add as many websites as needed via the "Add New Website" button

**Files Modified**: None (no limit existed in code)

---

### 2. Edit Website Functionality
**Issue**: No way to edit website URLs or keywords after adding them (typos were permanent).

**Solution**: 
Added comprehensive edit functionality with the following features:
- ✏️ Edit button on each website tile
- Inline edit form that opens when clicking edit
- Ability to modify:
  - Domain name
  - Search keyword
  - Weekly quota
- Cancel and Save buttons for user control
- Form uses distinct orange/amber styling to differentiate from "Add" form

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/automation-dashboard.tsx`

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [editingWebsite, setEditingWebsite] = useState<WebsiteData | null>(null);
const [showEditWebsite, setShowEditWebsite] = useState(false);
```

**New Functions**:
```typescript
handleEditWebsite(website: WebsiteData)  // Opens edit form
handleSaveEditWebsite()                   // Saves edited website
```

**UI Changes**:
- Added edit button (✏️) to each website tile
- Edit form appears below control panel when editing
- Form has amber background (#fff7ed) to distinguish from add form

---

### 3. Delete Website Functionality
**Issue**: No way to delete websites from the dashboard.

**Solution**: 
Added full delete functionality with safety measures:
- 🗑️ Delete button (red-themed) on each website tile
- Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete {domain}? This action cannot be undone."
- Automatic cleanup:
  - Removes website from the list
  - Removes from selected websites if it was selected
  - Removes custom context if one exists
- Visual feedback with red border/color on delete button

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/automation-dashboard.tsx`

**New Function**:
```typescript
handleDeleteWebsite(domain: string)  // Deletes website with confirmation
```

**UI Changes**:
- Added delete button (🗑️) with red styling (#ef4444)
- Button shows on hover title: "Delete website"
- Integrated with context cleanup system

---

### 4. Bulk Keyword Import
**Issue**: Had to add keywords one at a time in the context editor (slow and tedious).

**Solution**: 
Implemented intelligent bulk keyword import that accepts comma-separated values:
- Detects comma-separated input automatically
- Splits, trims, and filters keywords
- Works for both:
  - Custom Keywords section
  - Seasonal Modifiers (fall, winter, summer, spring)
- Single keywords still work as before (backward compatible)

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/context-editor-modal.tsx`

**Updated Functions**:
```typescript
addKeyword()           // Now handles both single and comma-separated keywords
addSeasonalKeyword()   // Now handles both single and comma-separated keywords
```

**Example Usage**:
```
Input: "thanksgiving, pumpkin, turkey, stuffing, cranberry"
Result: Adds 5 keywords at once
```

**UI Changes**:
- Updated placeholder text: "Add keyword or paste comma-separated: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3..."
- Added helpful tip: "💡 Tip: Paste multiple keywords separated by commas for bulk import"
- Seasonal inputs also show: "Add {season} keyword or comma-separated list..."
