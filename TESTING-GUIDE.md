## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ On branch `feature/test-changes`
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation successful

### **Test 1: Recipe Theme Feature**

1. **Open** http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **Add websites** using "Add New Website" button:

   - **Run 5**: "appetizer recipes air fryer cooking", "side dish recipes air fryer cooking"

### **Test 3: Mixed Theme Testing**

1. **Test different themes**:
   - `summer BBQ` → Should generate BBQ-related keywords

## 🎉 **Expected Outcome**

After testing, you should see:
1. **Recipe themes work perfectly** - Keywords include your entered themes
2. **Keyword rotation works perfectly** - Different keywords each time with no theme
3. **Both features work together** - Seamless integration
4. **Fresh content discovery** - Each search explores new recipe angles
5. **No more repetition** - The old problem of identical keywords is solved!

**The system now generates fresh, varied keywords every time, ensuring your recipe searches discover diverse content instead of repeatedly searching the same terms!** 🚀
